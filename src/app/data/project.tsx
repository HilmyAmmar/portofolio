      "A full-stack POS web app for small businesses (UMKM), built with Django and Next.js to streamline product, transaction, and user management. Completed 4 Agile sprint cycles, contributing to planning, implementation, sprint reviews, and retrospectives",
    highlights:
      "Product and transaction management, user management, financial reporting with export, multi-role access, email invitations, and more.",
    contribution:
      "I focused on developing user management features, including user access listing, email-based invitations with role assignment, and invitation link validation. I also implemented secure authentication using JWT and role-based access control to enhance security and ensure smooth multi-role access. In addition to development, I contributed to planning, design, and the final pitch. I also fixed bugs and assisted in completing tasks across other features when needed.",

    highlights:
      "Semantic search over NFCorpus, Elasticsearch-powered indexing, query expansion using LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), document highlighting, and scalable search interface.",
    contribution:
      "I implemented the full backend architecture using Django, including Elasticsearch integration and scalable RAG-based search API. I built the query expansion logic using Mistral LLM, allowing enriched search terms for better recall. I also designed and optimized the multi-field Elasticsearch search strategy and crafted RAG prompts that guided the LLM to generate accurate and relevant responses. On the frontend, I contributed to integrating React components for displaying highlighted results and search summaries.",
